<b>Instructions</b>

In the middle of the screen, two cards lay face up.  The left card is the player's and the right is the computer's.  By pressing the "DEAL" button, both cards will change.  The one with the higher card after the change gets a point.  If the two cards are of equal value, neither player gets a point.  Aces are high, and suits are ignored.  The player with the most points is in the lead.
